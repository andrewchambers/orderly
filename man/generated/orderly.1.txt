ORDERLY(1)                                                                             ORDERLY(1)

NAME
       orderly - run and supervise processes.

SYNOPSIS
       orderly supervisorspec... -- <progspec...> [-- ...]

DESCRIPTION
       orderly  Provides ordered starting, supervision and stopping of a collection of processes.
       orderly starts a list of processes in order, then monitors them with provided health check
       scripts. On failure, processes are stopped and restarted in a well specified order follow‐
       ing the specified restart strategy. On unrecoverable errors, orderly itself aborts  execu‐
       tion.

       Arrangement of orderly invocations in a tree hierarchy allows the creation of fault toler‐
       ant process supervision trees.

SIGNALS
       On SIGINT orderly sents SIGINT to all processes in reverse order, and waits  for  them  to
       exit.  If  the process spec has a shutdown grace period, processes are killed with SIGKILL
       after the shutdown grace period has elapsed.

       On SIGTERM orderly kills all processes in reverse order, then exits as soon  as  possible.
       Cleanup scripts will be run in reverse order next time orderly is restarted.

              TODO

       -max-restarts NUM (default=5)
              TODO

       -status-file PATH:
