.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBorderly\fR Provides ordered starting, supervision and stopping of a collection of processes\. \fBorderly\fR starts a list of processes in order, then monitors them with provided health check scripts\.
.
.P
On failure, processes are stopped and restarted in a well specified order\. Scripts can also be provided to cleanup after a failed process (unmounting filesystems, deleting files, etc\.)\.
.
.P
Arrangement of \fBorderly\fR invocations in a tree hierarchy allows the creation of fault tolerant process supervision trees\.
.
.SH "SUPERVISOR SPEC FLAGS"
.
.SS "\-max\-start\-tokens NUM (default=5)"
The size of the start pool, when this pool less than one and a (re)start is required \fBorderly\fR aborts\. Each (re)start decreases the pool size by one\. Note that the initial start is counted towards the quota, so the pool size must be at least 1 for a successful startup\.
.
.SS "\-start\-tokens\-per\-second NUM (default=0\.1)"
The rate at which restarts are added into the (re)start pool\.
.
.SS "\-status\-file PATH"
If specified, a file to be written containing the current status of \fBorderly\fR\. The file will contain either "STARTING", "RUNNING"\. \fBorderly\fR transitions from starting, to running after all procesess it is controlling have started successfully at least one time\. The main use for this file is for creating nested \fBorderly\fR supervision trees that start in order\.
.
.SS "\-on\-start\-complete BIN"
An optional hook to run when the first startup completes successfully,
.
.SS "\-on\-restart BIN"
An optional hook to run before each restart that is triggered by a command failure\.
.
.SS "\-on\-failure BIN"
An optional hook to run when orderly encounters an unrecoverable error, and must abort operation\.
.
.SS "\-on\-shutdown BIN"
An optional hook to run just before orderly exits after a clean shutdown\.
.
.SS "\-all\-lifecycle\-hooks BIN"
Shorthand for setting all lifecycle hooks to the same script, in this case env variables can disambiguate the action to take\.
.
.SS "\-{start\-complete,on\-restart,on\-failure,on\-shutdown}\-timeout SECONDS (default=120)`"
The number of seconds to wait for a given hook before giving up and triggering a restart\. A negative value means no timeout\.
.
.SS "\-check\-delay PATH (default=5)"
The amount of time in seconds to wait between health check loops\.
.
.SH "PROCESS SPEC FLAGS"
.
.SS "\-name NAME"
The name of the service, passed to all callbacks under the env variable as \'ORDERLY_SERVICE_NAME\'\.
.
.SS "\-run BIN"
The command invoked by \fBorderly\fR to launch a supervised process\. If this program exits, it will trigger a restart\.
.
.SS "\-wait\-started BIN"
An optional command invoked concurrently with the service, it should exit with a 0 exit code when this process is ready and the next process can be started\.
.
.SS "\-check BIN"
An optional command invoked periodically as a health check\. If this commands times out or returns an unsuccessful exit code, a restart will be triggered\. This check is in addition to ensuring the run process has not exited\.
.
.SS "\-shutdown BIN"
An optional command to shutdown the supervised process\. If not specified, \fBorderly\fR will send SIGTERM to terminate the supervised process\.
.
.P
The shutdown command may be run if a command start times out, a sibling process dies and the server needs to restart, or orderly is shutting down\.
.
.SS "\-clean BIN"
An optional command to cleanup any resources the running process may have left\. If it exits with an unsuccessful exit code, a restart will be triggered\. Process cleaning should be idempotent, and always happens in reverse order to process startup\.
.
.SS "\-all\-commands BIN"
Shorthand for setting all commands to the same script, in this case env variables can disambiguate the action to take\.
.
.SS "\-{wait\-started,check,shutdown,clean}\-timeout SECONDS (default=120)`"
The number of seconds to wait for a given command before giving up\. A negative value means no timeout\.
.
.SS "\-terminate\-timeout SECONDS (default=10)`"
The amount of time to wait after a shutdown command before terminating the child with a SIGKILL if it does not exit on it\'s own\.
.
.SH "PROCESS SPEC ENV VARIABLES"
The following env variables are passed to any specified process scripts\.
.
.SS "ORDERLY_SERVICE_NAME"
The name of the process being managed\.
.
.SS "ORDERLY_ACTION"
One of START_COMPLETE, RESTART, FAILURE, RUN, WAIT_STARTED, CHECK, SHUTDOWN, CLEANUP depending on which action \fBorderly\fR is requesting\.
.
.SS "ORDERLY_SUPERVISOR_PID"
The pid of the orderly process\.
.
.SS "ORDERLY_RUN_PID"
The pid of the supervised process, if it is running\.
.
.SH "SIGNALS"
.
.SS "SIGINT SIGTERM"
\fBorderly\fR shuts all processes down with the provided or default shutdown commands in reverse order\.
.
.SH "EXIT CODE"
\fBorderly\fR exits with a zero exit code only if shutdown after a SIGINT or SIGTERM occured with no errors\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
Given the executable service script \'sv\':
.

.nf

  #! /usr/bin/env bash

  set \-eu

  p () {
    echo "$ORDERLY_SERVICE_NAME $ORDERLY_ACTION"

Logging facilities may be added in the future, though currently a logging process can simply be part of the process list, and can be sent input via named pipes or any other mechanism\.
